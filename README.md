# ChatServer
Chat Server in Java

Scalable Computing Assignment 1:

Name: Salil Ajgaonkar
TCD ID: 17317640

How to Run?
1) Clone the repository
2) run the JAR file located in ChatServer/Java_ChatServer/chat_server/dist/chat_server.jar
Command: $ java -jar chat_server.jar
3) Server will run on port 8001 on the Machine IP

Issues:
1) When the assignment was given I started my work on the project using Haskell as was encouraged in class. 
Coming from a background of Object Oriented Programming and no prior experience in Functional programming languages like Haskell,
I was faced with a learning curve that took most of my time just trying to understand how Haskell works. Burdened with assignemnts
from other module strands I couldnt learn Haskell fast enough to start working on the assignment, After finding out that
I'm running out of time I switched to Java where I was able to get a server running.

2)The next issue I faced was that the Test Server which was being used to test our server code was not able to connect to the 
Java/Haskell server that I had run on my laptop. I was however able to connect to it via a locally running client. What followed was
a series of trial and error debuggin involving experimenting with SCSS NEBULA, AWS and Turing juggling with other Assignments.
It was only a few days prior the deadline that I was able to debug the issue that SCSS NEBULA is restricted within its own VPN and
that it is not able to clone my code from github. Being in the same VPN as the test server the test server was only able to communicate
with SCSS Nebula. Then I realised that the only way to push my code to SCSS Nebula is doing a secure copy from my machine to turing and
then from Turing to SCSS Nebula. This was the time when I had my entire server hosting system up and can further go ahead with the development.
However by this time it was almost deadline and I had plenty of work from other modules pending and considering the fact that this assignment
has only 20% of weightage and that I have spent a lot of time than I should be for 20% of weightage I decided to stop working on it
and try catch up with the other modules. Hoping to score better in the next assignments.
